        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
     <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
     <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
     <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
     <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
     <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
     <li>The charset element sets our character encoding.</li>
     <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
     <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage</li>
     <li>The html opening tag,  represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. Inside the html tag is an attribute (for example: lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage, in this case, en for English). An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
     <li>the !DOCTYPE declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
     <li>Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>

   <h2>CSS</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
  <li>A border indicates the properties of a line around the content and it's padding.</li>
  <li>A CSS rule includes: a selector, which defines the element or attributes to which the rules (or declarations) will apply. Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
  <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
  <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #. </li>
  <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
  <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
  <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements. </li>
  <li>the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>

   <h2>Git</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
    <li>git add -A: stages all files in the working branch prior to committing</li>
    <li>git commit -m "message here": commits staged changes; the -m flag associates a message with our commit.</li>
    <li>git pull origin main: we use the pull command to recieve a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates what the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword is indicating our main branch as that source. </li>
    <li>It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work. Otherwise, you might be working on outdated code!</li>
    <li>git push origin "branch": we are using a new command push to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch. When using the push command, you can create a new remote branch or add new changes to an existing branch.</li>

   <h2>JavaScript</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:</li>
    <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement.</li>
    <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!</li>
    <li>STRING: let myVariable = 'Bob'; 
        This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.</li>
    <li>NUMBER: let myVariable = 10; 
        This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
    <li>BOOLEAN: let myVariable = true; 
        This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
    <li>ARRAY: let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
        Refer to each member of the array like this:
        myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.
        This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
     <li>OBJECT: let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
            All of the above examples too.
            This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.</li>
    <li>Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.</li>
    <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:

        /*
        Everything in between is a comment.
        */</li>
    <li>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:

        // This is a comment</li>
    <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the following bullets, you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in the JavaScript console.</li>
    <li>ADDITION: 6 + 9;
        'Hello ' + 'world!'; Add two numbers together or combine two strings.</li>
    <li>SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION: 9 - 3;
        8 * 2; // multiply in JS is an asterisk
        9 / 3; These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.</li>
    <li>ASSSIGNMENT: let myVariable = 'Bob'; As you've seen already: this assigns a value to a variable.</li>
    <li>STRICT EQUALITY: let myVariable = 3;
        myVariable === 4; This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result</li>
    <li>NOT, DOES-NOT-EQUAL: For "Not", the basic expression is true, but the comparison returns false because we negate it:

        let myVariable = 3;
        !(myVariable === 3);
        
        "Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with different syntax. Here we are testing "is myVariable NOT equal to 3". This returns false because myVariable IS equal to 3:
        
        let myVariable = 3;
        myVariable !== 3; This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.</li>
    <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement. For example: let iceCream = "chocolate";
        if (iceCream === "chocolate") {
          alert("Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!");
        } else {
          alert("Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite…");
        }
        Copy to Clipboard
        The expression inside the if () is the test. This uses the strict equality operator (as described above) to compare the variable iceCream with the string chocolate to see if the two are equal. If this comparison returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code—after the else statement—runs instead.</li>
    <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
    <li>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— () —it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</li>
    <li>For example, the alert() function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.</li>
    <li>You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function which takes two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:

        function multiply(num1, num2) {
          let result = num1 * num2;
          return result;
        }</li>
    <li>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse.</li>
